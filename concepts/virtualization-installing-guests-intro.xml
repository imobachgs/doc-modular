        This section provides generalized instructions for installing a &vmguest;.
      </para>
    </abstract>
  </info>
  <para>
    A &vmguest; consists of an image containing an operating system and data
    files and a configuration file describing the &vmguest;'s virtual hardware
    resources. &vmguest;s are hosted on and controlled by the &vmhost;. 
  </para>
   <para>
    Virtual machines have few if any requirements above those required to run
    the operating system. If the operating system has not been optimized for
    the virtual machine host environment, it can only run on
    <xref linkend="gloss-vt-hwassisted"/> virtualization computer hardware, in
    full virtualization mode, and requires specific device drivers to be
    loaded. The hardware that is presented to the &vmguest; depends on the
    configuration of the host.

    You should be aware of any licensing issues related to running a single
    licensed copy of an operating system on multiple virtual machines. Consult
    the operating system license agreement for more information.
